XSettings-KDE is a XSettings
(http://standards.freedesktop.org/xsettings-spec/xsettings-latest.html) daemon, wrapping
some KDE configuration paramaters for XSettings aware applications, such as
most GTK+ applications.

Currently, it allows those applications to receive instant notification of the
following changes in KDE configuration:
-default font name and size
-theme name
-icon theme name
-maximum interval of time between two clicks to be considered as a double-click
-threshold to trigger drag and drop
-icon presence in stock buttons
-toolbar style (text only, icons only, ...)

This daemon is based on Owen Taylor xsetting reference implementation which can
be found on http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-specs/tree/xsettings
